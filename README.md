# Credit Risk Analysis using Logistic Regression

## Description

This project focuses on **Credit Risk Analysis** through the implementation of a **Logistic Regression model** to predict fraudulent transactions in credit card data. By utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, the project aims to classify transactions as either **low-risk (non-fraudulent)** or **high-risk (fraudulent)** based on various transaction features.

Due to the **imbalanced nature of the dataset**—with far fewer fraudulent transactions compared to non-fraudulent ones—techniques like **downsampling** are applied to ensure a balanced dataset for effective model training.

## Methodology

The project consists of the following key steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**:
   - Analyze the distribution of the target variable and key features.
   - Understand correlations between different transaction attributes.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature scaling for normalized data.
   - Splitting the dataset into **training and testing sets**.
   
3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a Logistic Regression model on the balanced dataset.
   - Identify and learn patterns associated with fraudulent transactions.
   
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model performance using:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1-score**
     - **Confusion Matrix**
   
This structured approach ensures a clear understanding of credit risk while addressing the complexities associated with **class imbalance** in predictive modeling.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used to develop and execute this project:

- **Python**
